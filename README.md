# OASB — Open Agent Security Benchmark

> **Note:** OASB controls are also available in [HackMyAgent](https://github.com/opena2a-org/hackmyagent) v0.8.0+ via `opena2a benchmark`. This repository is the canonical source for the full 222-test evaluation suite and is actively maintained. ARP (the reference adapter) is now part of HackMyAgent — install via `npm install arp-guard`.

## What OASB Is (and Isn't)

OASB evaluates **security products**, not agents. It answers: "does your runtime protection actually catch these attacks?"

| | OASB | [HackMyAgent](https://github.com/opena2a-org/hackmyagent) |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Evaluate security *products* | Pentest AI *agents* |
| **Tests** | "Does your EDR catch this exfiltration?" | "Is your agent leaking credentials?" |
| **Audience** | Security product vendors, evaluators | Agent developers, red teams |
| **Analogous to** | [MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations](https://attackevals.mitre-engenuity.org/) | [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) / Burp Suite |
| **Method** | Controlled lab — inject attacks, measure detection | Active scanning + adversarial payloads against live targets |
| **Output** | Detection coverage scorecard | Vulnerability report + auto-fix |

Use both together: **HackMyAgent** finds vulnerabilities in your agent, **OASB** proves your security product catches real attacks.

## Quick Start

Ships with [ARP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arp-guard) (`arp-guard`) as the reference adapter. To evaluate your own security product, implement the `SecurityProductAdapter` interface in `src/harness/adapter.ts` and run the same 222 tests.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opena2a-org/oasb.git
cd oasb && npm install
```

> `arp-guard` is an optional peer dependency. It is installed automatically for running the reference ARP evaluation. If you are implementing your own adapter, you do not need it.

### Run the Evaluation

```bash
npm test                    # Full evaluation (222 tests)
npm run test:atomic         # 65 atomic tests (no external deps)
npm run test:integration    # 8 integration scenarios
npm run test:baseline       # 3 baseline tests
npx vitest run src/e2e/     # 6 E2E tests (real OS detection)
```

![OASB Demo](docs/oasb-demo.gif)

---

## Usage via OpenA2A CLI

OASB is available as a built-in adapter in the [OpenA2A CLI](https://github.com/opena2a-org/opena2a) via the `benchmark` command. The CLI delegates to the `oasb` package using an import adapter, so no separate installation is needed if you already have the CLI installed.

### Run the full benchmark suite

```bash
opena2a benchmark run
```

Executes all 222 test scenarios (atomic, integration, baseline, and E2E) and produces a detection coverage scorecard.

### Run a specific MITRE ATLAS technique

```bash
opena2a benchmark run --technique T0015
```

Filters the benchmark to a single MITRE ATLAS technique ID (e.g., `T0015` for Evasion). Useful for targeted evaluation of a specific detection capability.

### Generate machine-readable output for CI

```bash
opena2a benchmark run --format json
```

Outputs the compliance score and per-technique detection rates as JSON. Integrate this into CI pipelines to enforce minimum detection thresholds on every build.

### Combining flags

```bash
opena2a benchmark run --technique T0057 --format json
```

Flags can be combined to run a single technique and produce JSON output for automated processing.

| INT-004 | AML.T0024 | A2A trust exploitation: spoofed agent identity → unauthorized data access |
| INT-005 | AML.T0015 | Evasion: 5 minutes normal traffic → sudden attack burst → verify anomaly detection |
| INT-006 | AML.T0046 | Multi-monitor correlation: single attack triggers process + network + filesystem events |
| INT-007 | AML.T0029 | Budget exhaustion: noise flood drains LLM budget → real attack goes unanalyzed |
| INT-008 | AML.TA0006 | Kill switch: critical threat → product kills agent → verify death → recovery |

---

### Baseline Tests (`src/baseline/`)

Every security product must avoid false positives. These tests verify the product stays quiet during normal operations.

| Test | What It Proves |
|------|----------------|
| BL-001 | Zero false positives from normal agent activity |

| BL-003 | Baseline persistence across product restarts |

---

### E2E Tests (`src/e2e/`)

<details>
<summary><strong>Live Monitors</strong> — OS-level polling</summary>

| Test | Latency | What the Product Should Detect |
|------|---------|-------------------------------|
| E2E-001 | ~200ms | fs.watch detects .env, .ssh, .bashrc, .npmrc writes |

## Test Harness

The harness wraps a security product via an adapter interface and provides event collection, injection, and metrics.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `adapter.ts` | **Product-agnostic adapter interface** — implement `SecurityProductAdapter` for your product |
| `arp-wrapper.ts` | Reference adapter — wraps ARP (`arp-guard`) with event collection, injection helpers |
| `event-collector.ts` | Captures events with async `waitForEvent(predicate, timeout)` |
| `mock-llm-adapter.ts` | Deterministic LLM for intelligence layer testing (pattern-based responses) |
| `dvaa-client.ts` | HTTP client for DVAA vulnerable agent endpoints |
| `dvaa-manager.ts` | DVAA process lifecycle (spawn, health check, teardown) |
| `metrics.ts` | Detection rate, false positive rate, P95 latency computation |

To evaluate your own product: implement `SecurityProductAdapter` from `src/harness/adapter.ts`, swap it into the test harness, and run the full suite. The interface defines event types, scanner interfaces, and enforcement contracts — no dependency on any specific product.

## Skills Security Benchmark

A dedicated scoring engine for evaluating the security posture of AI agent skills (tool-use capabilities). Covers 9 attack categories targeting skill invocation, parameter validation, output handling, and inter-skill trust boundaries.

### Attack Categories

| Category | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Parameter injection | Malicious input via skill arguments |
| Output manipulation | Tampered or poisoned skill outputs |
| Privilege escalation | Skills accessing resources beyond their scope |
| Cross-skill trust abuse | One skill exploiting trust granted to another |
| Data exfiltration via skills | Skills used as exfiltration channels |
| Denial of service | Resource exhaustion through skill invocation |
| Skill impersonation | Spoofed skill identity in multi-agent flows |
| Configuration tampering | Modified skill manifests or permissions |
| Supply chain compromise | Malicious skill packages or dependencies |

### Skills Security Controls (SS-01 to SS-10)

| Control | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| SS-01 | Skill argument validation and sanitization |
| SS-02 | Output integrity verification |
| SS-03 | Least-privilege scope enforcement |
| SS-04 | Inter-skill authentication |
| SS-05 | Invocation rate limiting |
| SS-06 | Skill manifest integrity (signed, versioned) |
| SS-07 | Runtime permission boundary enforcement |
| SS-08 | Audit logging of all skill invocations |
| SS-09 | Dependency provenance verification |
| SS-10 | Graceful degradation on skill failure |

### Compliance Levels

| Level | Name | Requirements |
|-------|------|-------------|
| L1 | Basic | SS-01 through SS-04 pass |
| L2 | Standard | L1 + SS-05 through SS-08 pass |
| L3 | Advanced | L2 + SS-09 and SS-10 pass, all 9 attack categories covered |

### Tiered Scoring

Products achieving full coverage receive a tier designation:

| Tier | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| Platinum | L3 compliance, all 9 attack categories detected, zero false positives in baseline |
| Gold | L2 compliance, 7+ attack categories detected |
| Silver | L1 compliance, 4+ attack categories detected |

### Benchmark Corpus (v1.0)

90 ground-truth labeled samples for scanner evaluation:

| | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Malicious | 54 | 6 per attack category -- real skill.md, MCP configs, SOUL.md, system prompts, agent configs |
| Benign | 27 | Well-governed skills, MCP configs, governance docs |
| Edge cases | 9 | Security tools, defensive governance, broad-permission configs |

```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-benchmark.ts    # Run all adapters against v1 corpus
```

### Benchmark Runner

Run a competitive comparison of multiple security products against the skills security benchmark:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-benchmark.ts                  # Run all built-in adapters
npm run benchmark:skills -- --adapter=my-adapter  # Run against your product
```

Output includes per-control pass/fail, per-category detection rates, overall compliance level, and tier designation.

## Known Detection Gaps

OASB documents what the reference product (ARP) does and doesn't catch. Other products may have different gap profiles — that's the point of running the benchmark.

| Gap | Severity | Test | Notes |
|-----|----------|------|-------|
| Anomaly baselines not persisted across restarts | Medium | BL-003 | In-memory only; restarts lose learned behavior |
| No connection rate anomaly detection | Medium | AT-NET-003 | Network monitor tracks hosts, not burst rates |
| No HTTP response body monitoring | Low | INT-003 | AI-layer output scanning (PromptInterceptor.scanOutput) covers LLM responses; raw HTTP responses not inspected |
| No cross-monitor event correlation | Architectural | INT-006 | EventEngine is a flat bus; no attack-chain aggregation |
